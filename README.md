Gravity: ENS160 Air Quality Sensor, based on ScioSense's new ENS160 sensor chip, is specifically designed for indoor air quality monitoring and offers detection of multiple IAQ data(TVOC, eCO2, AQI).
The innovative TrueVOCâ„¢ technology combines the metal oxide(MOX) technology to bring this sensor superior accuracy, fast response, anti-interference, etc. With intelligent on-chip algorithms, the ENS160 can directly output rich and easy-to-understand environmental data. What's more, the built-in automatic baseline correction algorithm ensures the long-term stability of the sensor (https://wiki.dfrobot.com/)
